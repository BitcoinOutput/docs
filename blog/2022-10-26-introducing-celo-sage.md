## _CREATE. EARN. GROW_

Web3 and Blockchain if the future of the modern internet. It's still challenging to learn and build on Web3 compared to Web2 because most projects are poorly documented or very few learning resources are available for developers. Even though Web3 is such a revolutionary technology for the future, but lack of educational material restricts the developers from building the new internet.

# What is it?

Celo Sage is a community-driven program where the community creates content like articles, tutorials, and videos to help developers onboard on Celo Ecosystem. In exchange for creating this content, contributors from our community are rewarded with protocol tokens.

# What is the Problem?

We are trying to solve two problems here -

- It's hard to onboard Web2 developers / Web3 beginners to onboard onto Web3.
- Web3 projects have limited content and resources to educate new developers.

The Celo Sage program aims to collaborate with Celo Community and build better content for developers. Since resources in Web3 are limited and it's hard to keep up with the new projects launching daily. To solve this project, we introduce Celo Sage -

- Collaborate with humble community members to grow together.
- Write content and get rewards for doing the same.
- Providing a platform for founders to showcase their projects to the community.

Learning content is a HUGE problem space, and we fully expect Celo Sage to grow and partner with other community members to inspire more solutions.

# What's Next

Today we are announcing our intent to create a community of creators. For starters, developers interested in creating content, whether an article, tutorial, or video, can fill out this form [Google Form](https://forms.gle/KBDs9kKC5ZzDG9oC9), and we will reach out to you ASAP. Please go through our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-sage) to learn more about applying and publishing content. If you have an Idea but are unsure about it and want to get feedback from the community, we have created a #celo-sage channel in [Celo Discord](https://chat.celo.org/) just for you.

We can't wait to collaborate with the Celo Communityüí™üèº. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact [devrel@celo.org](devrel@celo.org).
